  Unfortunately, the following transfers failed.  Sometimes the connection
  is lost and the transfer fails.  If this happens multiple times, please
  let us know, as it may be another issue.</p>

<p>If you have recently synced your Dropbox to your personal computer, then a large number of failed transfers may indicate that
the sync process is incomplete.  Please wait before trying again.
