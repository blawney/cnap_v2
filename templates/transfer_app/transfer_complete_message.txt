{% if failed_transfers|length > 0 %}
  Unfortunately, the following transfers failed.  Sometimes the connection
  is lost and the transfer fails.  If this happens multiple times, please
  let us know, as it may be another issue.

  If you have recently synced your Dropbox to your personal computer, 
  then a large number of failed transfers may indicate that
  the sync process is incomplete.  Please wait before trying again.
